This is a tool for auto differentiating computations specified in Relational Algebra. The generated backprop can be imported/implemented on top of a RDBMS.

`example.py` is an example about how to differetiate a two layer MLP.

Three benchmarks:
(1) NNMF
(2) GCN
(3) KGE

RJPs are mainly implemented under `relationAD.py`.
